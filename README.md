# WineQualityPrediction
A large dataset is considered and wine quality is modelled to analyze the
quality of wine through different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, pH, etc. The
parameters are analyzed through machine learning algorithms like KNN, Logistic Regression
and SVM which will allow us to rate the wine as good, bad or medium.
